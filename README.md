### Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well suited for image recognition. In this work, speeded up by GPU
supported by the Google Colab, CNNs and variants built with Keras on TensorFlow are trained with 39393
subsampled, balanced non-IDC or IDC Breast Histopathology Images first, then applied to 13131 test images and
obtained a test accuracy of 84.2%.
